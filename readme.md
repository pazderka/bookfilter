# How to setup this project

- No special action is required to open this project, as it is only html, css and javascript. Just open it in a browser or in some live environemnt (e.g. live server in VSCode).

# Used technologies

- For this app i have used html, pure javascript (es6+) and pure css (flex, grid), no frameworks, no libraries as times to times a like to do things the most basic way and for something like this framework is really not needed in my opinion.

# Bonus functionality / view (Bonus parts from tasks also included, except search prioritization)

- 1. Clear Search functionality
- 2. css truncated book title when the book details is opened and it is too long.

# Not implemented
- 1. Search prioritization (i cant see an easy solution in a small amount of time)
- 2. Not sure if i understood correctly how the structure of the book itself should look like, now when the page loads, the name is via grid displayed over all the 3 columns, when the book detail is opened, it becomes 2-column flex and styling is updated accordingly (the most suitable solution in my opinion). If this should be structured differently, i may update it till the end of a week.

# Areas to improve
- 1. Simplify search function
- 2. Add media queries for responsivity
- 3. play with animations a little bit more
